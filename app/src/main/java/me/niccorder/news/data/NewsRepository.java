/**
 * API for providing data, in this case data about the news.
 *
 * We use an interface here because an interface only has method signatures. This means that there
 * is absolutely no code that is attached to an interface, and this helps keep our code clean.
 *
 * Clean code means that each component has a strong SoC (separation of concerns). A strong SoC
 * allows us to write unit tests for each component, and help us become a strong test driven
 * developer.
 *
 * TL;DR – Whenever you are hacking it out, write a good interface because it saves your ass later
 * down the road.
